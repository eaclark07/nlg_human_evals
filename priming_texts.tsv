Stories	Once upon a time magic was an art. The great magicians of the time would take on apprentices who would train for a decade or more, slaving under their tutelage for the hope of one day being the next great magician. They were free from the bonds of apprenticeship only once they had made the perfect magic circle. Only then could they harness the power of the mages and go off on their own. But times changed, magicians were persecuted, and few longed to toil away for the long years of study necessary. In the course of a century, magic became extinct.	Once upon a time, there lived an old woman. She was as you'd expect an old woman to be in most respects, brittle and stooped as though whatever foundation still held her old bones up might break at any minute and cause the whole abode to come tumbling down. Her eyes were glazed like a bakers treats - what they'd come to call cataracts in years to come. Her joints were all swollen, such that her fingers were like poorly balanced, chubby spiders from a children's tale. But not all was as one thinks an old woman should be.\n \n She was wise beyond sight.	Once upon a time, there lived a boy who was a close friend to the princess of a rival town.\n \n They, despite the many warnings made by their fathers, were close to one another, often seen sneaking pieces of raided pies from the marketplace vendors and chasing each other in the meadows that rested between the two towns.\n \n For many years, the townspeople tolerated their friendship, many secretly hoping that it would lead to a truce between each other.\n \n However, on the boy's fifteenth birthday, the uneasy peace between the rivaling factions was shattered as rumors of the princess being kidnapped spread and sparked an almost palatable bloodlust in the girl's people.

Headline: Connecticut’s Beardsley Zoo Welcomes New River Otter Following Renovation of Habitat\n Article: Connecticut’s Beardsley Zoo is the new home for Tahu, a one-year-old female North American river otter newly arrived from the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Wash. After the Zoo’s last river otter passed away in 2019 from advanced age, the Zoo engaged in long-planned improvements to the otter habitat. With renovations complete, Tahu has joined the Zoo family and will be joined by a male companion in the future. As a species, river otters have suffered from habitat loss, water pollution, and fur trapping. Their numbers are on the rise due to reintroduction programs in parts of the U.S., better water quality, and protection of their habitats. Zoo Director Gregg Dancho said, ``Our river otters have always been some of the most popular animals who make their home here at the Zoo, for their playful nature and intelligence as well as their role as an iconic North American animal.
