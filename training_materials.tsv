Story	Once upon a time, there was a man in a place that was not a place at all.\n \n He didn't know anything of a place or a time or who he was or what he was doing there. There was just him and the silence.\n \n He sat there for a long time, not knowing what he was doing there. He thought, thought and thought, but he didn't know what to think. There was just him and the silence. He tried to speak, but no sound came from his mouth. He tried to move, but his body would not move. He sat there, but he didn't know for how long he was there.	Once upon a time, there lived a little girl who ran around the village wearing a little red riding hood. Don't ask me what a riding hood is because I don't even know. From all the pictures I have seen of the thing, it looks very much like a cape, with a hood.\n \n This girl's idiot mother allowed her to travel around the village unsupervised. Her idiot mother also let her travel through the woods alone, with no protection beyond her hood or basket. Not a very smart parent, if you ask me. This girl can't have been older than ten or eleven.

Her birth was not unexpected; her father had long since wanted a daughter, and her mother had long since been unable to give him one. So it was that when, after years of childless marriage, a daughter was born, they rejoiced.\n \n The girl was raised in the lap of luxury, and as she grew, she came to expect that the world would be at her beck and call. The girl who had once been pampered and coddled was now pampered and coddled, and grew to be quite the vain, spoiled brat.	Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a princess scowled at the newspaper. Another of her friends had been kidnapped. Another! that made six this month. She tore the thing neatly in two and almost threw it at her handmaiden, declaring, ``this has to stop. I mean, isn't life difficult enough for princesses without the constant threat of kidnap hanging over our heads?''\n \n The maid raised a delicate eyebrow, her thoughts turning to her own difficulties, so far removed from those of her employer, ``highness, I don't think there's anything to be done about it ...'' she complained.\n \n This was met with a disparaging look from Princess Ellionora, who rose to her feet, dislodging one of the flowers in her hair with a sudden head movement.	Note that though there are some capitalization errors, the [human-authored] story is original and engaging.	Human	Once upon a time, there lived a girl who was the daughter of the greatest wizard of her time.\n \n She was the daughter of the great wizard, yet she was not a very good magician.\n \n Her father instructed her to practice her magic every day. He told her to polish off the dust of the books in his library, clean the dishes in the kitchen, and sweep the front of the house.\n \n She did not enjoy her chores.\n \n She wanted to go with the other girls in the village and play. But she had to do her chores.	Once upon a time, there was a young man named Neil. Neil's family was made up of warriors on his mother's side, and poets on his father's side.\n \n His parents were certain that Neil would take up one or the other profession. But Neil had no interest in bloodshed, and suffered from a terribly tied tongue. And from the time he could read, to to the time when he was ten years old, Neil felt alone in his own family, a self-imposed outcast.\n \n However, one day, Neil saw something that changed his perspective on life. A visiting dignitary had come to the tribe to seek an alliance with them.	Note that there seem to be some inconsistencies [in the machine-generated story]; first it says the father orders her to practice magic, then it says he orders her to do chores.	GPT3

Headline: Twitter reacts to former South Dakota QB Chris Streveler playing for Arizona Cardinals\n Article: Former University of South Dakota quarterback Chris Streveler replaced Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray, and South Dakotans are loving it. It became Chris Streveler time for the Cardinals early in the first quarter when Murray went down with a right ankle injury. Streveler completed his first NFL pass to Trent Sherfield and then tossed a pass to Jonathan Ward, who ran past several Los Angeles Rams' defenders for a touchdown — the first of Streveler's professional career. The touchdown catch was Ward's first touch of his career. Streveler did throw a pick-six just before halftime, giving the Rams a 12-7 lead. The 6-foot-1 216-pound Streveler played sparingly earlier this season, but only for a few short run plays. With a win in Sunday's game, the Cardinals would make the playoffs.
